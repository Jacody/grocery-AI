Grocery-AI
Let AI sort your grocery list — first with Fuzzy Naive Bayes, then with Ollama for the uncertain ones.

This project intelligently categorizes grocery items by supermarket sections. It uses a two-step AI system:

Fuzzy Naive Bayes Classifier – Quickly assigns most items based on pre-trained probabilities and fuzzy matching.

Ollama-powered LLM – Handles uncertain or ambiguous entries using a local large language model for improved accuracy.

Ideal for anyone wanting a smart, automated way to organize their shopping.
